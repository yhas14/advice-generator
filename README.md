## Welcome! 👋

This is a FrontenMentors-Challenge[https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db]
That generates advice using an api[https://api.adviceslip.com/advice] that auto generates quotes

## What I learned 😁

- I learned how to fetch data from an api and use that data inisde HTMl elements

= I also learned API's aren't as intimidating as I perceived
